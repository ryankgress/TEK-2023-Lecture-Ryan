Inquizitive is a site that allows you to make an account, register a quiz team, 
and find/report local bar trivia in your area. It also aims to give people a 
nice place to meet, compete, and find places to go every night of the week, in 
every city!

    - Form functionality for Signin/Register
    - Updatable Navbar/Footer after signing in
    - Report standings for trivia nights, potentially admin-only
